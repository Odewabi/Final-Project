                        them
                        to sit for 10 minutes while you prepare the breading ingredients. (Don't wipe off any salt or

                        1
                        cup tomato sauce and 1 cup shredded mozzarella cheese. Add the second layer of eggplant (we like
                        to

                        1 cup shredded mozzarella on each stack. Top with the remaining 2 tablespoons grated Parmesan

                        if
                        it's not spicy enough, add more peppers to taste. Simmer partially covered, for 7 to 10 minutes
                        until the flavor is smooth and rich (or up to 15 minutes if the tomatoes are not fire roasted).
