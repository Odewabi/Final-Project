        <p class="card-text">Restaurants in Rome each have their own version of cacio e pepe, and we've been lucky
            enough to sample quite a few (we prefer the version at Roscioli if you're planning a trip!). Here's what
            you'll need for this spin on the classic:</p>
    </div>
    <ul class="list-group list-group-flush">
        <li class="list-group-item">Spaghetti or bucatini pasta: Spaghetti is most traditional. We also like
            bucatini (pictured), which is like hollow spaghetti</li>
        <li class="list-group-item">Pecorino Romano cheese: This sharp, salty aged cheese is what carries the
            flavor of cacio e pepe. There's absolutely no substitute for it!</li>
        <li class="list-group-item">Parmesan cheese: Using this secondary, ore popular cheese helps to round out
            the flavors. Don't want to buy two cheeses? Substitute more Pecorino (it's just as authentic).</li>
        <li class="list-group-item">Butter: This extra ingredient helps the sauce to come together.</li>
        <li class="list-group-item">Black pepper: A generous helping of pepper rounds out the dish.</li>
