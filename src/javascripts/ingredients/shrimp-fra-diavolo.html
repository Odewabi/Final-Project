        <p class="card-text">Fra Diavolo sauce is a spicy Italian tomato-based sauce for pasta and seafood, named
            “Brother Devil” for the intense heat. Origin stories of the sauce vary, but it's most likely Italian
            American, invented at Italian restaurants in New York City in the early twentieth century. One New York
            City restaurant, Grotta Azzurra, claims to have been serving Lobster Fra Diavolo since 1908.<br>

            Shrimp Fra Diavolo is a spin on the lobster version of the dish that's more economical: and it's become
            popular on restaurant menus these days. This punchy sauce brings a kick! But made at home, it's easy to
            customize to the eater. Here's what you'll need for this dish:</p>
