        <p class="card-text">This stuffed zucchini boats recipe is a fun and easy way to turn zucchini into a main
            dish. It's loads easier than Zucchini Lasagna with similar flavors, and works for gluten-free and
            vegetarian diets. Here we used plant-based sausage, which has come a long way in the last few years.
            It's not something we eat often, but it's a great option here: or you can use a homemade version. More
            on that below! Here's what you'll need for zucchini boats:</p>
